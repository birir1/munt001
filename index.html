                        <p>
                            My priority is to ensure that pioneer international university students have access to high quality education. For the better part of all the years that we have spent in PIU, the quality of education has been satisfactorily offered. It is my firm conviction
                            that the quality of education being offered by our “International” university is not to the standards it should be. This will require rethinking at every quality aspect concerned with education in universities.

                        <h2>QUALITY OF SERVICES</h2>
                        <P>It is most disconcerting that, even when the quality of services offered by most universities are so glaring, our institution still dwells on the old school habit in service delivery even when the world is progressing and technologically
                            diversified in different sectors. We still are rummaging to long queues for physical issuance of academic transcripts, semester unit registration, manual class attendance register, school fee services including balance requirement.
                            It suffices to point out that an international institution of our stature should not be having this type of unstructured service delivery mechanism.

                        <p>The power of an institution is not based on its brand, not our buildings, not our pomp and circumstance—as wonderful and terrific as that is. This University, Pioneer International University, is its people—their aspirations, their
                            achievements—their diversity of background, experience and thought—their desire to see beyond themselves and their devotion to serving others. But all these are determined by two factors, innovation, and talent. Vast majority
                            of universities have fully invested in innovation and research by having fully equipped research and development centers. Our institution should not be an exception to this. We must catalyze our commitment and involvement in
                            innovation by ensuring we recognize all the innovative ideas presented by students, help them incubate their ideas, motivate all innovators and talented people by broadening their experiences through competitions and exposure
                            to the market.

                        </h2>
                        <p>As per the title of our school, one may easily conclude that our institution is indeed an international institution with international standards. PIU is well respected, not because its academic achievement, but because of its title
                            itself “Pioneer International University”. It would be disappointing to note that the education standards offered in PIU do not align as per the title of the institution. I believe that most of you have been asked not a few
                            times, how PIU is different from other Universities and whether there is any international connection or collaboration attached to this institution. Of course, we all know the obvious answer to that. No solid answer would be
                            given in such instance.

                            Joining clubs in universities is one of the greatest ways to get involved on campus. It is through the clubs that we can meet people, explore our different interests by participating in what piques our interest, and more importantly, we are able to learn
                            more about group dynamics. Clubs being engaging, helps students reduce study stress and heavy academic workloads by focusing on what interests them most. Through these, different talents are recognized and skills sharpened.

                        <p>

                            Tuition fee is a major concern in any institution. It is neither a hoax nor a joke. With the current economy that affects all, it requires that we change how we previously were handling and managing our finances. It is a requirement that tuition fees
                            be paid by all students. But the ratio of payment as per the institution requirement does not favor the students.

                        <p>

                            Gender balance and equality is a sensitive consideration that should be implemented at all aspects of inclusion in our society. We therefore need to devise a comprehensive approach to tackling gender inequality, making substantial progress requiring long
                            term vision supported by each senior leadership team, an official set of values and regulations, which are enforced, and addressed by dedicated staff or offices that are responsible for gender equality. That is what Pioneer
                            international University should be aiming for.

                        <p>
                            Whenever one wants to address issues on academia, there is a sense in which one cannot forget the fundamental role played by sports. There is a direct correlation between sports and education as research has shown that cognitive functions and improved
                            memory are products of the intercourse between education and sports. Clearly the sporting sector in our institution has fairly been critical and I believe there is a lot more that needs to be done to make it more efficient.
                            Each sport within the institution can be elevated to the levels required and that can be through championing for provision of adequate tools, materials and the gears for various games. In addition to the existing internal competitions
                            within the institution, more has to be done to motivate the students and promote further intervarsity competitions which could go a long way promoting the talents of the individuals.
